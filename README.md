Practice worksheet for analyst roles and responsibilities 
# Data-Related Job Dashboard (Excel)

## Overview

This project is an Excel-based **Data-Related Job Dashboard** built as part of *Project 1* from the course **“Excel for Data Analytics – Course for Beginners”** by Luke Barousse. The goal of the project was to explore how Excel can be used for structured data analysis, aggregation and insight communication using real-world-style data.

The dashboard focuses on analysing data-related roles across multiple dimensions such as job titles, employment types, geographic distribution, salaries and hiring platforms.

## Key Objectives

* Practise data cleaning and preparation in Excel
* Apply analytical thinking using formulas and conditional logic
* Build an interactive dashboard that communicates insights clearly
* Strengthen foundational data analysis skills using Excel

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains job postings related to data roles, including information such as:

* Job title (short and standardised)
* Country
* Employment type (full-time, contract, internship, etc.)
* Salary (yearly average)
* Hiring platform

The data was converted to Data Table within Excel before being used for analysis and visualisation.

## Features & Analysis

### Dashboard Highlights

* **Job Title Analysis**: Comparison of median salaries across data-related roles
* **Employment Type Breakdown**: Salary distribution across full-time, contract, part-time, internship and temporary roles
* **Geographic View**: Country-level distribution of job postings
* **Platform Insights**: Identification of popular hiring platforms
* **Summary Metrics**:

  * Median salary based on selected conditions
  * Job count per role and filters

### Excel Concepts Used

* Conditional formulas (`IF`, `ISNUMBER`, `SEARCH`)
* Aggregation functions (`COUNT`, `MEDIAN` with conditions)
* Lookup functions (`XLOOKUP`)
* Data validation and filtering
* Sorting and structured tables
* Dashboard layout and formatting for clarity

---

## Learning Outcomes

* Gained a deeper appreciation of Excel as a serious analytical tool
* Understood how moderate to complex operations can become computationally intensive, even in Excel
* Improved ability to translate raw data into meaningful insights
* Reinforced core analytical habits such as curiosity, attention to detail, and structured problem-solving
